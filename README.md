# ThinkAi-
An ai chat bot 


ThinkAi is a Flask-powered Socratic chatbot that guides users to learn concepts through questions instead of direct answers.
It asks 5–6 guiding questions, then gives a final complete answer — with a touch of wit and humor.

Socratic method – never gives the answer directly until enough reasoning is built.

Funny + Engaging – adds playful remarks and humor to keep things light.

 Modern Chat UI – WhatsApp-like chat bubbles, responsive design.

 New Chat button – reset the conversation anytime.

 Typing indicator – shows “ThinkAi is typing…” while generating responses.

 Final Answer – after 6 questions, ThinkAi summarizes and provides a complete explanation.
